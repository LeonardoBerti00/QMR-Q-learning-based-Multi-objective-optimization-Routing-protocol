# DroNET - QMR

In this work I've implemented the Q-learning based protocol proposed in [QMR:Q-learning based Multi-objective optimization Routing protocol for
Flying Ad Hoc Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366419308278?casa_token=NhWQp9UblrwAAAAA:OjW0zXdRc0zG9DVrI7dEGC58jNk-DYJOZkHObmrgghZVyUJqV62Gc7mUcAVAWdl0flFTsMeI) by Liu et al. using DroNet, a Python based simulator for experimenting routing algorithms and mobility models on unmanned aerial vehicle networks, created by Andrea Coletta and Matteo Prata, both PhD students at Sapienza University of Rome.
